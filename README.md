## About the Video Course
Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for building fast, scalable network applications easily. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive, real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

This video course is a step-by-step guide for creating a high performance server in JavaScript. The course begins with installing Node, to understanding modules and file streams, and setting up a server. The course also teaches you different web application frameworks and explores advanced features such as web sockets and key-value stores.

This comprehensive video tutorial will take you from a beginner-level programmer and teach you everything you need to know to get productive with Node. Fundamental concepts are illustrated with brief examples and many sample projects that help grasp the complex functionality in an easy manner.

With a primer on modules and npm, you'll understand how to work with building blocks of Node and publish your own creations. Accelerated development with frameworks like Express will make your app more responsive with caching and real-time communication.

This course is an indispensible guide to building a Node app, whether from the ground up or with the help of higher-level frameworks.
